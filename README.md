# Water Scarcity Adaptation Toolkit (2026)

Python toolkit to calculate local water scarcity risk scores and simulate adaptation strategies like AI leak detection, smart irrigation savings, and basic desalination feasibility.

**2026 Context**  
- UN declares "era of global water bankruptcy" (Jan 2026 report): chronic depletion, overuse, climate heating → billions at risk.  
- Trends: Smart water management booming (AI leak detection, real-time sensors, digital irrigation mainstream). Market to $22.6B+ in 2026.  
- Focus: Drought adaptation via efficiency (reduce non-revenue water 20-40%), predictive forecasting, low-energy tech.

Goal: Simple calcs + viz for risk + intervention impact.
